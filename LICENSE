# MIT License for **Bike Rental** Project

Below are ready-to-use files and code snippets to add the **MIT License** to your Bike Rental project.

---

## 1) `LICENSE` (copy this whole file into a file named `LICENSE` in your repo)

```

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal

```

**Replace** `<YEAR>` with the current year (e.g., `2025`) and `<OWNER>` with your name or organization (e.g., `Shad Khan`).

---

## 2) License header snippet for Python files

Add this at the top of your Python scripts and notebooks (as a comment) to make the license explicit:

```python
# MIT License
# Copyright (c) 2025 Shad Khan
#
# Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
# of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
# in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
# to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
# copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
# furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:
#
# The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
# copies or substantial portions of the Software.
#
# THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
# IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
# FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
# AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
# LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
# OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
# SOFTWARE.
```

> For Jupyter notebooks, place a short license block in the first markdown cell, or include a file `LICENSE` in the repo root and link to it from notebook text.

---

## 3) Add license to `README.md` (badge + short statement)

Add this near the top of your README to show the license:

```markdown
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License — see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.
```

---

## 4) Git commands to add and push the LICENSE file

Run these commands from your project root:

```bash
# create LICENSE file (or paste contents into LICENSE)
git add LICENSE
git commit -m "Add MIT license"
git push origin main
```

If your default branch is `master` or another name, use that branch name instead of `main`.

---

## 5) Package metadata examples

* **Python (setup.cfg / pyproject.toml)**

`setup.cfg` snippet:

```ini
[metadata]
license = MIT
```

`pyproject.toml` snippet:

```toml
[project]
license = { text = "MIT" }
```

* **package.json (JavaScript projects)**

```json
{
  "name": "bike-rental",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

---

## 6) Short note on selecting a license

The MIT License is permissive: it allows others to use, modify, and redistribute your code, including in proprietary projects, while requiring attribution and preserving the liability disclaimer.

If you want stronger copyleft (force derivatives to remain open-source), consider GPL-family licenses instead.

---

If you want, I can:

* Replace `<YEAR>` and `<OWNER>` for you with the correct values and update the LICENSE file content; or
* Create a ready-to-download `LICENSE` file and add a one-line license cell to your `Bike_Rental.ipynb` notebook.

Tell me which option you prefer and I will create it.
